# walker

This was a project I worked on while I was learning the basics of my first programming language, Java. Although standard coding conventions were not followed, I think my heart was in the right place as I tried to express my creativity in a mathematical way. So, this is my attempt at algorithmic art.

## Running the program

Pretty simple - clone this repo and run `Launcher.java`. The "art" will follow a few seconds later in a pop-up. The parameters for the artwork can be modified in `Walker.java`, so have fun messing with the settings if you'd like to make something colorful (or not). Here's a sample video that's supposed to resemble earth, and a few other outputs below:
